Has anyone actually looked at the Java code for the AMX? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I don't know about the search functionality. That might be online. Depends how it's gonna work. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, you just concatenate them together. It just means it loads on demand. It only loads when it needs a particular type of file, like when it's being accessed. Yeah, I think that's the idea. It just loads the particular ones it needs. But if you were doing a search over the whole corpus, you'd have to load them all.
